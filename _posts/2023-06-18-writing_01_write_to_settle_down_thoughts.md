> ... (People) keep crashing into what they are blind to until the crashing leads them to adapt </br>  -- Principle by Ray Dalio

I long for adaption to crashing in life and work, and writing seems like the corner I kept cutting but should stop decades ago.

## Writing Forces Myself Staring into the Abyss
Repeated problems in Life/work are handled sub-optimally or poorly despite:
1. The problems are not complicated, new, or unique
1. The pain is excruciating
1. The time to adapt is enough
1. The desire to adapt is intense

For me, the missing step might be forcing myself to "stare into the abyss".\
When a similar situation re-occurs, the feeling likes "going to an awful restaurant again despite knowing the foods are the worst".\
It is not pleasant to admit failures and look into the abyss so that I just want to quickly let it get out of my mind.

Writing forces me.

## Writing Organizes Thought
The reflection calls for organizing fragmented thoughts into a mind map, and writing is the stage.

We enjoy shower time to focus and generate insights ([blog](https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/)), but sometimes we need a longer period and papers as extended brains RAM.

The process to write down the anatomy of the mindset might be similar experiences as [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) or [flow](https://www.amazon.com/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Perennial-Classics/dp/0061339202/ref=sr_1_1?crid=13Q735K5OO2X7&keywords=flow&qid=1687143929&s=books&sprefix=flo%2Cstripbooks%2C137&sr=1-1).

## Just Start Writing
I thought I could:
- remember the pains and adapt afterward
- block a time afterward to think through

Sometimes I did, and many times I did not.

I thought writing is like an evitable and tedious process as long as I process all the info through all the steps in my mind.

I was wrong, for a long time.\
Writing is a corner I should stop cutting.

Bias for action!
