Friction occurred when collaborators disagree with my claims which I am confident in.

## Self-requirements As a Junior Eng

My Eng career started with humility and intense desire to learn.
I rarely argued with senior colleagues since they are much more believable and I was there to learn from them.
- I never felt any code comment was nitty, or the bar was too high as unnecessary blockers.
- For questions and suggestions, I deeply appreciated, and carefully prepared responses with humility.

## As My Tenure Grows

After years of staying in a team, I became the contact person in some areas, and started to give comments, questions, and suggestions. Then my stupidity show began.
- I argued in code review by a high bar, many times by readability.
- I asked people in following standard processes.\
When people ignored or refused, as my manager said, I was frustrated.
- I questioned designs or implementations, especially when I was confident, I pushed hard and argued hard, which caused friction.\
I did not understand why people (silently) rejected something absolutely right to me.

Collaborating as a domain expert could be an opportunity to build trust and reputation, but those behaviors and more importantly the mindset that people "should" follow the standard I appreciated damaged my community relationships, productivity, and most importantly working experience.

## Mindset Adaption

There was quite a long time I believed the problem can only be mitigated by long-term improvements in patience and communication skills, and the expected timeline will be by my 40s or 50s on the optimistic side.\
Recently I realized I need a fundamental adaption: expect a journey to sell a disagreement.

The conclusion I am confident in depends on various factors, including personal experience, problem understanding, priority, and expectation.\
Any conflicting factor could lead to a completely different conclusion, and it takes a journey instead of a one-step correction.

The disagreement might not be resolved until all factors are addressed.\
As a side topic, I started to realize it is a blessing to have collaborators who proactively explore disagreements and find/fill gaps, and I want to be one of them.

Notably, the effort to resolve a problem does not scale with the problem size. For example, a disagreement in a variable naming can be attributed to the habits and experiences in the past 10 years or the intention of the reviewer to block the progress. 

There are also cases people ignore standards:
- a low-credit project was left half-way by another person who left the team.
- the writer had a near-miss in the past promotion, and is eager to deliver this time.

Honestly, I could have the same drive in this situation, and maybe it is the right thing to keep the bar, but the point here is that the agreement could be a non-short journey.

The adaption of the expectation helps with prioritization and time estimation. For example, deprioritize or budget more time when some disagreement occurs.

## Afterword
Looking back at the problem, I feel funny that the reasoning is so simple, but took so much time.\
I read words like "don't expect people to agree easily" or "people are wired differently" so many times without much feeling.\
Now everything makes sense and agrees on this point.\
Deep thinking helped me in the adaption, and was far not enough in past years.\
This supports another blog ([Write to Settle Down Thoughts]({{site.baseurl}}/writing_01_write_to_settle_down_thoughts/)).

This topic has not been fully addressed here, and I will polish it as the deep thinking goes on.
